# These are docker arguments that `numerai node deploy/test` will always pass into docker.
# They are then set in your environment so that numerapi can access them when uploading submissions.
# You can also access them from your script like so:
    # import os
    # public_id = os.environ["NUMERAI_PUBLIC_ID"]
    # secret_key = os.environ["NUMERAI_SECRET_KEY"]

# This sets the default command to run your docker container.
# It runs by default in the cloud and when running `numerai node test`.
# This is overridden when using `numerai node test --command [COMMAND]`.
